  <h1>Part 1</h1>
  <dl>
    <dt>What is code review?</dt>
    <dd>A code review is a process of peer developers systematically inspecting another's code, or their own code from some time ago, for quality prior to the date of release.</dd>

    <dt>Why is it an important practice for computer science professionals?</dt>
    <dd>A brand new or fresh pair of eyes often catches mistakes, errors, or inefficient structure that would be missed when one examines the same code for a long period.</dd>

    <dt>What are some code review best practices that you read about in the resources that are crucial to include in a code review?</dt>
    <dd>Limit review session length to 60 minutes; add annotations to the code prior to conducting the review; use checklists to guide the review process, especially to highlight each feature that the code may be missing.</dd>

    <dt>Include when a code review should occur in the development process with a rationale as to why.</dt>
    <dd>In general, a code review should occur between iterations of the project, such as before a new branch is created, but before anything is merged to the main branch or published.</dd>
  </dl>

  <h1>Part 2</h1>
  <dl>
    <dt>What software have you chosen to use to record your code review?</dt>
    <dd>I will use ScreenPal to conduct my code review.</dd>

    <dt>Describe your approach to creating an outline or writing a script for your code review for each of the three categories that you will be reviewing based on the rubric as well as the code review checklist.</dt>
    <dd>Since the code review is informal, I am planning to go off of the checklist and speak in the moment. The main reason is that if I read off of a script, this may not translate well within the time limit. I also believe that due to the nature of the assignment, the review process will be more authentic if I do not write a script in advance.</dd>
