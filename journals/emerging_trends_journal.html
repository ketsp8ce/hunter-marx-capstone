      <h2>Part One</h2>

      <h3>What is the significance of each trend?</h3>
      <p>
        The two trends I will be examining are <strong>Generative AI</strong> and <strong>5G networking</strong>.
        Generative AI is the most obvious global trend in not only computer science but technology itself worldwide.
        AI is infiltrating every area of life, even areas in which its use-case is questionable.
        5G, on the other hand, has assumed a quieter but equally transformative takeover.
        It is faster than any previous networking technology, and its prevalence represents the most significant change
        in smartphone technology since the first iPhone.
      </p>

      <h3>How will each trend change the field of computer science?</h3>

      <h4>Generative AI</h4>
      <p>
        Many programmers are now "vibe coding" — relying heavily on AI-assisted code generation.
        While this technology has broadened what beginners can create, it has also damaged the integrity of technical knowledge.
        The most drastic negative effect is in <strong>security culture</strong> and <strong>DevSecOps</strong>.
        If team members only partially understand the application’s logic, vulnerabilities are bound to arise.
      </p>

      <h4>5G</h4>
      <p>
        5G offers higher speeds and lower latency than any internet technology before it.
        This necessitates new <strong>security protocols</strong> and drives innovations in <strong>edge computing</strong>.
        Its ultra-low latency enables near real-time processing — critical for technologies like autonomous vehicles.
      </p>

      <h3>How will each trend change the experience of consumers, workers, or citizens?</h3>

      <h4>Generative AI</h4>
      <p>
        Its impact on academia has been immense for both students and teachers.
        Among average users, AI tools are beginning to replace social interaction.
        Long-term developmental effects remain unknown, but short-term studies suggest habitual AI use may decrease cognitive performance.
      </p>

      <h4>5G</h4>
      <p>
        5G allows even remote regions to access high-speed internet, unlocking both opportunities and challenges.
        However, misinformation has led to <strong>EMF conspiracy theories</strong>, rooted in misunderstandings of basic physics.
        Many do not realize that radiation is simply the movement of particles through a medium.
      </p>

      <h3>How will each trend fit in with your career interests or aspirations?</h3>

      <h4>Generative AI</h4>
      <p>
        Since 2015, I have been fascinated with AI and science fiction concepts.
        However, I have become disillusioned with the direction generative AI has taken.
        Rather than enhancing human creativity, it has become a tool for exploitation and superficiality.
        As a result, I prefer to avoid AI-centric work and focus on other areas of technology.
      </p>

      <h4>5G</h4>
      <p>
        5G’s advances in speed and reliability have driven innovations in <strong>IoT</strong> and <strong>cloud computing</strong>.
        I am deeply interested in systems engineering and machine code, both of which will benefit from this connectivity revolution.
      </p>

      <h3>Which course outcomes have you achieved so far, and which ones remain?</h3>
      <p>
        I believe I have successfully met 4 out of 5 course outcomes. The only one remaining involves
        developing a <strong>security mindset</strong>, as none of my projects have yet focused on cybersecurity.
