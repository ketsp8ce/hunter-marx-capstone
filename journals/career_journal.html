  <h1>Journal 2: Career Development and Artifact Progress</h1>

  <article>
    <h2>Part One</h2>

    <h3>Have you changed your career plans? If so, what prompted this change?</h3>
    <p>
      I have indeed changed my career plans. When I first chose to commit to SNHU’s computer science program, I had previously desired to major in molecular biology. I wanted to work in bioinformatics, pharmacogenomics, pharmacology research, or some related field, but I did not want to work in a lab setting. I thought that gaining a background in computer science would allow me to work in one of these fields from a theoretical angle, such as writing software. Throughout my time in the computer science program, however, I fell in love with many other subjects within tech. Now, I am not set on working in a biotech-adjacent field and would be happy working in IT, cybersecurity, or numerous other areas of technology.
    </p>

    <h3>How has your thinking about your career evolved?</h3>
    <p>
      I originally wanted to work in something biotech adjacent due to my longstanding interest in molecular biology and pharmacology. However, I have also had a deep interest in technology and computer science. I tried and failed to learn to code several times in middle school and high school, but I always felt as though I could excel in these areas with proper guidance and structure. My interest in bio/pharm was, at least in part, influenced by my own health issues and health anxiety—a neurotic drive to understand my body and pain through scientific knowledge. I eventually realized that pursuing a career based on anxiety wasn’t a psychologically healthy path for me. In contrast, my interest in technology has always been purely conceptual—something I can engage with freely and creatively without obsession.

    <h3>Have you completed any research about your choice of career? Have you thought about seeking an advanced degree or certification after earning your undergraduate degree?</h3>
    <p>
      I have conducted research in various areas of technology by reading articles, watching videos, and consulting career counselors. Alongside completing more computer science courses, I’ve discovered that information technology encompasses most of my interests. I’ve been studying for the CompTIA Security+ and Network+ certifications, and after graduation, I plan to pursue one of these paths. I also remain open to other types of roles and internships such as software engineering or AI. The job market is tough right now, so I intend to explore all opportunities. I have considered pursuing additional certifications or possibly a graduate degree in the future.
    </p>

    <h3>Which course outcomes have you achieved so far, and which ones remain?</h3>
    <p>
      In my first enhancement for Artifact 1, I identified the following course outcome: 
      <em>“Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.”</em> 
      I believe I met this outcome by writing a professional tutorial and implementing a structured version control process.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my second enhancement, I proposed the outcome: 
      <em>“Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices.”</em> 
      I met this by reconstructing an OpenGL 3D model in Unity, applying algorithms and data structures in a new environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my third artifact, I initially chose the wrong outcome in my enhancement plan. I now believe it will best align with:
      <em>“Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science.”</em>
      This will be demonstrated as I construct a client-server environment replicating what I learned in my Client/Server Development course. I’ll host a server with a database and rebuild the CRUD module.
    </p>
    <p>
      The originally proposed outcome for Artifact 3 was:
      <em>“Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.”</em>
      While that still applies to all three artifacts, I consider it already achieved through my previous work.

    <h3>Provide an update to your instructor on your progress with each category of artifacts for the ePortfolio:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Software Design and Engineering:</strong>  
        I have completed the majority of a tutorial on Linux Virtualization for beginners. The Arch Linux section is finished, and I plan to add Kali Linux and Debian components soon.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Algorithms and Data Structures:</strong>  
        I have completed a 3D model of a frilled shark plushie in Unity, originally built in OpenGL. I plan to add lighting and possibly a background in the future.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Databases:</strong>  
        I have yet to begin my third artifact, which will involve recreating a client-server development environment, hosting a server and database, and implementing CRUD functionality.
