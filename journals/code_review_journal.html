      <h3>What is code review?</h3>
      <p>A code review is a process of peer developers systematically inspecting another’s code—or their own code from some time ago—for quality prior to the date of release.</p>

      <h3>Why is it an important practice for computer science professionals?</h3>
      <p>A brand-new or fresh pair of eyes often catches mistakes, errors, or inefficient structure that would be missed when one examines the same code for a long period.</p>

      <h3>What are some code review best practices that are crucial to include?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Limit review session length to 60 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add annotations to the code prior to conducting the review.</li>
        <li>Use checklists to guide the review process, especially to highlight missing features.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>When should a code review occur in the development process?</h3>
      <p>In general, a code review should occur between iterations of the project—before a new branch is created, but prior to merging to the main branch or publishing. This ensures stable progress and quality control.</p>

      <h3>What software have you chosen to use to record your code review?</h3>
      <p>I will use <strong>ScreenPal</strong> to conduct my code review.</p>

      <h3>Describe your approach to creating an outline or script for your review.</h3>
      <p>Since the code review is informal, I plan to use the checklist as my main guide and speak naturally during the review. If I were to read directly from a script, it might sound less authentic and could affect timing. Speaking freely allows for a more genuine and thoughtful review.</p>
