  <h3>Narrative Questions or Reflections:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?</strong>
      My original artifact, which can be viewed if you switch to the “original” branch, was created for cs340, Client Server Development. It used Dash and Jypiter Notebook for frontend and used CRUD modules (create, read, update, delete) to query a database run on MongoDB. Queries were written in python scripts using jypiter notebook. Backend configuration was completely set up for the students in Apporto.</li>
    <li><strong>Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?</strong>
      This artifact was my first experience working with databases and querying. I selected this as a previous project in my history which suited the subject of databases most appropriately. Although I gained experience working with client server development and databases, I lacked a deeper understanding of the backend system.</li>
    <li><strong>Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?</strong>
      I said in my enhancement plan that I believed the following course outcome would be met: "Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals."
      I believe this matches the outcome of this project well. I moved from using a pre-configured environment to establishing my own environment on my machine. This is one of the most important skills in computer science, as when I am just coding on top of a black-box backend, I don’t deeply understand what I am doing.</li>
    <li><strong>Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?</strong>
      Firstly, I took my project which originally used generic data and changed it to Pokémon related data as this was more fun. It was easy to find a Pokémon API that was free and open source. I then re did pretty much the entire process of the original project.
      This was the most fulfilling and enriching of my three enhancements. I learned so much about full stack development. I practiced version control, environment configuration, coding and everything in between. I found this experience to pull from a versatile mix of skills in my toolbox.
      I had trouble managing my workflow at first. I needed to run the MongoDB server, the Python Environment, and connect to Flask. I was able to manage this better as soon as I realized I could use multiple terminals at once for different purposes.
      I also struggled briefly with querying the data because I mixed up my API fetch script with importing the data into MongoDB.
      With both of the areas I struggled with, I placed clear instructions in my README guide, so that anyone who downloads the contents of my repo can clearly follow my instructions to get the thing working.
      In the future I might call on friends or collaborators to expand on the graphics (html, CSS and JavaScript) and possibly even have images. Either way, this project is a fantastic addition to my portfolio.</li>
