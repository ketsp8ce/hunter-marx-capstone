      <h3>Narrative Questions or Reflections:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?</strong>
          <p>My original artifact, which can be viewed on the “original” branch, was created for CS340 (Client-Server Development). It used Dash and Jupyter Notebook for frontend and utilized CRUD operations to query a MongoDB database. Queries were written in Python scripts using Jupyter Notebook. The backend environment was initially pre-configured for students in Apporto.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?</strong>
          <p>This artifact was my first experience working with databases and querying. I selected it because it aligns with the database-focused category in my portfolio. While I gained experience with client-server development, the original project limited my understanding of the backend system, which I enhanced by building my own environment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?</strong>
          <p>I aimed to meet the course outcome: “Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices to implement solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.” By moving from a pre-configured environment to manually establishing my own, I strengthened my understanding of backend systems—an essential computer science skill.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?</strong>
          <p>I replaced the generic data with Pokémon data, making the project more engaging. I utilized a free Pokémon API and rebuilt much of the original project. I learned full-stack development hands-on, practiced version control, environment configuration, and improved coding workflow. Initially, managing multiple terminals for MongoDB, Python, and Flask was challenging. Querying errors due to script mix-ups were resolved, and clear instructions were added to the README for future users. This project provided a versatile skill set for my portfolio and can be expanded with collaborators for additional functionality and graphics.</p>
