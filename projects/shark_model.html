        <strong>Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?</strong>
        <p>My original artifact was the final product of a 3D modeling class (CS330), where I created a 3D model of my frilled shark plushie using OpenGL. The goal of this project was to reproduce the camera movement, lighting, and texturing of the original artifact in Unity, a modern 3D engine. The original OpenGL version can be found <a href="https://github.com/ketsp8ce/3D-shark-model-openGL">here</a>.</p>

        <strong>Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?</strong>
        <p>I chose this artifact because it demonstrates my skills in algorithms, data structures, and 3D modeling. Creating the original model in OpenGL required instantiating a vector space and building vector-based 3D objects, applying linear algebra concepts in real time. In Unity, the same concepts apply through shaders and mesh objects, but with a higher-level GUI interface. Using Unity allowed me to produce a better final product, while my prior experience with OpenGL gave me a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithmic and structural principles.</p>

        <strong>Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?</strong>
        <p>Yes. This project aligns with the course outcome: <em>"Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices."</em> Although I had never used Unity before and scripting in C# was optional, the project still required understanding of the same algorithmic and data structure principles as the original OpenGL version. My prior OpenGL experience helped me recognize these underlying principles while working in Unity.</p>

        <strong>Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?</strong>
        <p>In OpenGL, I manually positioned shapes and textures with no GUI, which made precise adjustments challenging. Unity provided a GUI and shortcuts that made manipulating shapes, lighting, and textures much easier. I learned to balance parameter editing with GUI interactions for efficiency. My main challenge was the fine-motor precision required for positioning, which is affected by my learning disabilities. With practice, I plan to use a mix of editing methods to enhance future projects.</p>
