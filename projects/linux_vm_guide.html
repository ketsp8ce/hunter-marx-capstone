      <h2>Linux VM Guide</h2>
      <p>This project provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and configuring Linux Virtual Machines. The goal was to create an accessible resource for beginners and intermediate users.</p>
      <p>Challenges included covering various distributions, ensuring clarity in instructions, and troubleshooting common VM issues.</p>

      <h3>Narrative Questions or Reflections:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?</strong>
          This artifact is a tutorial on Linux virtualization. It originated as a series of unofficial experiments.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?</strong>
          Learning about Linux and how to install it requires understanding the basics of software architecture and its underlying logic. Writing my own guide from scratch along with explanations for each step required a strong conceptual understanding of software development layers. The artifact evolved from an unofficial series of experiments to a streamlined, accessible guide.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Did you meet the course outcomes you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?</strong>
          I met the course outcome: "Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts." Writing this tutorial allowed me to practice professional writing and break down tasks for clarity.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?</strong>
          I learned how difficult it is to create a concise tutorial for beginners on an open-ended task. Determining what to include, consolidate, screenshot, or infer took far more time than anticipated. I completed only the Arch Linux segment for now and plan to add Kali and Debian in the future. This process taught me to think critically about clarity and structure in technical documentation.
