      </ul>

      <p>
  I believe I have successfully met four of the five course outcomes through the completion of my Capstone artifacts. The only outcome that remains partially unmet involves developing a <strong>security mindset</strong>, as none of my current projects specifically focus on cybersecurity. The following describes how each artifact aligns with the other four course outcomes.
</p>

<h4>1. Employ strategies for building collaborative environments</h4>
<p>
  While most of my coursework and Capstone projects were completed independently, I demonstrated collaborative practices through consistent use of <strong>version control with Git and GitHub</strong>. I structured my repositories with clear branches, meaningful commit messages, and readable documentation to make my work accessible and replicable by others. This approach reflects real-world collaborative workflows and prepares me to work effectively within a team environment in future professional projects.
</p>

<h4>2. Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality communications</h4>
<p>
  My Capstone portfolio itself demonstrates professional communication by presenting each artifact with coherent technical documentation, design overviews, and visual representations. In particular, the <strong>Linux Virtualization Guide</strong> was designed to communicate complex setup instructions clearly for users of all experience levels. Each section is structured and written with clarity, tone, and consistency appropriate for a technical audience, showcasing my ability to produce professional-quality written and visual materials.
</p>

<h4>3. Design and evaluate computing solutions using algorithmic principles and best practices</h4>
<p>
  The <strong>3D Shark Model Project</strong> directly supports this outcome. I applied algorithmic thinking to develop and evaluate 3D transformations, coordinate systems, and rendering processes in both OpenGL and Unity environments. Recreating the model across two platforms required understanding the trade-offs between low-level and high-level abstraction, performance optimization, and rendering efficiency. This project demonstrates my ability to apply computer science principles to design and evaluate solutions that solve real technical problems.
</p>

<h4>4. Demonstrate effective use of computing techniques, skills, and tools to deliver industry value</h4>
<p>
  The <strong>Pokémon Dashboard Database Project</strong> reflects my ability to leverage modern technologies and tools to create practical, value-driven solutions. I built this client–server web application using the <strong>MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js)</strong>, applying CRUD operations and RESTful API integration. By setting up the environment manually instead of using a preconfigured system, I demonstrated independence, technical skill, and problem-solving ability—skills that translate directly to real-world software development workflows.
</p>

<p>
  Together, these artifacts illustrate my growth across multiple areas of computer science: collaboration and version control, professional communication, software design, and technical implementation. Each project has strengthened my ability to conceptualize, plan, and deliver computing solutions that are both functional and professionally presented.
</p>


      <p>
        As I near the end of my Computer Science program, I have gained a great deal from this Capstone course. I was challenged to enhance past projects in three key areas: software design, data structures and algorithms, and databases.
        This course was extremely open-ended and required a high degree of creativity and independent thinking. I spent significant time in the planning stage, carefully crafting my design document. I always enjoy open-ended opportunities in school and took advantage of this one to develop areas of knowledge that I was already passionate about.
      </p>

      <p>
        SNHU’s project-based curriculum has provided a unique opportunity to build my professional portfolio as part of my academic journey. Early in my program, I struggled with version control and often used GitHub like a cloud storage service. This can be seen in my earlier projects such as the CS360 Weight Tracking App and the CS370 Machine Learning project, where the repository structure was disorganized and lacked meaningful commit messages. However, as I progressed, I improved significantly—by the time I completed the CS465 Full Stack Development project, I had mastered the basics of version control. This growth has allowed me to confidently include my school projects in my professional portfolio.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my program at SNHU, I have had limited opportunities to collaborate in a team environment, but I plan to work with the Coding United club and collaborate with friends on team-based projects in the future. My skills in version control will allow me to contribute effectively to group efforts. Communicating with stakeholders in a professional setting will, in many ways, be similar to following course requirements—sometimes there are strict guidelines, and other times, more flexibility and creative freedom.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve learned about the Software Development Process, how to craft Design Documents, and how to create class and UML diagrams. I’ve taken courses in backend development such as CS305, frontend development using Android Studio in CS420, and full-stack development in CS475, where I built a complete web application using JavaScript and the MEAN stack. Courses such as Data Structures and Algorithms have strengthened my understanding of paradigms, frameworks, and the best use cases for each.
      </p>

      <p>
        SNHU’s curriculum exposed me to multiple programming languages including C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript. My work in CS330 (Computer Graphics and Visualization) tested my ability to apply linear algebra and data structures in 3D modeling using OpenGL. I also learned about relational databases and schema design in CS340, where I built a client-server database application using MongoDB and CRUD functionality. Many of my projects integrated multiple areas of learning—such as my CS370 Machine Learning project, where I created a program that used a machine learning model to solve a maze.
      </p>

      <p>
        For my Capstone artifacts, I enhanced two past school projects and one personal project. For software engineering, I built on my personal Linux experimentation by creating a detailed guide for getting started with Linux virtualization. This project highlights both my passion for IT and my commitment to continuous learning beyond coursework.
      </p>

      <p>
        For data structures and algorithms, I expanded on my OpenGL 3D modeling project from CS330, where I modeled a frilled-shark plushie. I have long been interested in game development and 3D graphics, so I recreated the same 3D model in Unity. This process helped me understand how Unity applies the same linear algebra principles as OpenGL but at a higher level of abstraction, making it more user-friendly and accessible. Working with both environments deepened my conceptual understanding of 3D graphics and game engines.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, for the databases category, I recreated my animal shelter database project from CS340. In the original version, the environment was pre-configured using Apporto, which simplified setup but limited my understanding of the underlying system. In the new version, I built the application on my local machine and used Pokémon data from a free public API instead of animal shelter data. This process helped me better understand client-server architecture, environment configuration, and database management. Debugging setup issues forced me to deepen my understanding of key development environment concepts such as variables, paths, and directory systems. Each project I complete strengthens my appreciation for how software interacts with its environment, and that continues to fascinate me.
