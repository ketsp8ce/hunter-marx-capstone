      <h2>Self-Assessment and Reflection</h2>

      <p>
        As I near the end of my Computer Science program, I have gained a great deal from this Capstone course. I was challenged to enhance past projects in three key areas: software design, data structures and algorithms, and databases.
        This course was extremely open-ended and required a high degree of creativity and independent thinking. I spent significant time in the planning stage, carefully crafting my design document. I always enjoy open-ended opportunities in school and took advantage of this one to develop areas of knowledge that I was already passionate about.
      </p>

      <p>
        SNHU’s project-based curriculum has provided a unique opportunity to build my professional portfolio as part of my academic journey. Early in my program, I struggled with version control and often used GitHub like a cloud storage service. This can be seen in my earlier projects such as the CS360 Weight Tracking App and the CS370 Machine Learning project, where the repository structure was disorganized and lacked meaningful commit messages. However, as I progressed, I improved significantly—by the time I completed the CS465 Full Stack Development project, I had mastered the basics of version control. This growth has allowed me to confidently include my school projects in my professional portfolio.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my program at SNHU, I have had limited opportunities to collaborate in a team environment, but I plan to work with the Coding United club and collaborate with friends on team-based projects in the future. My skills in version control will allow me to contribute effectively to group efforts. Communicating with stakeholders in a professional setting will, in many ways, be similar to following course requirements—sometimes there are strict guidelines, and other times, more flexibility and creative freedom.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’ve learned about the Software Development Process, how to craft Design Documents, and how to create class and UML diagrams. I’ve taken courses in backend development such as CS305, frontend development using Android Studio in CS420, and full-stack development in CS475, where I built a complete web application using JavaScript and the MEAN stack. Courses such as Data Structures and Algorithms have strengthened my understanding of paradigms, frameworks, and the best use cases for each.
      </p>

      <p>
        SNHU’s curriculum exposed me to multiple programming languages including C++, Java, Python, and JavaScript. My work in CS330 (Computer Graphics and Visualization) tested my ability to apply linear algebra and data structures in 3D modeling using OpenGL. I also learned about relational databases and schema design in CS340, where I built a client-server database application using MongoDB and CRUD functionality. Many of my projects integrated multiple areas of learning—such as my CS370 Machine Learning project, where I created a program that used a machine learning model to solve a maze.
      </p>

      <p>
        For my Capstone artifacts, I enhanced two past school projects and one personal project. For software engineering, I built on my personal Linux experimentation by creating a detailed guide for getting started with Linux virtualization. This project highlights both my passion for IT and my commitment to continuous learning beyond coursework.
      </p>

      <p>
        For data structures and algorithms, I expanded on my OpenGL 3D modeling project from CS330, where I modeled a frilled-shark plushie. I have long been interested in game development and 3D graphics, so I recreated the same 3D model in Unity. This process helped me understand how Unity applies the same linear algebra principles as OpenGL but at a higher level of abstraction, making it more user-friendly and accessible. Working with both environments deepened my conceptual understanding of 3D graphics and game engines.
      </p>

      <p>
        Finally, for the databases category, I recreated my animal shelter database project from CS340. In the original version, the environment was pre-configured using Apporto, which simplified setup but limited my understanding of the underlying system. In the new version, I built the application on my local machine and used Pokémon data from a free public API instead of animal shelter data. This process helped me better understand client-server architecture, environment configuration, and database management. Debugging setup issues forced me to deepen my understanding of key development environment concepts such as variables, paths, and directory systems. Each project I complete strengthens my appreciation for how software interacts with its environment, and that continues to fascinate me.
